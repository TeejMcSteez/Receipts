            <p className="mb-8 text-base leading-relaxed">
                This site is here to share documented cases of government misconduct, questionable decisions, and oversight failures.<br />
                We only use publicly available information like court documents, official reports, and investigative journalism.<br />
                Every entry cites its source.<br /><br />
                We are not here to defame anyone or anything. We are here to document what's already out there so people don't have to dig through 400-page PDFs or forgotten news articles.

                This site is for informational purposes only.<br />
                We do not guarantee every detail is 100% current or correct because, let's be honest, even government documents aren't.<br /><br />

            <p className="mb-2 text-base leading-relaxed">Hi. This document avoids traditional legalese because we value clarity over jargon. Courts in multiple jurisdictions (see Hill v. Gateway 2000) have upheld agreements written in plain language as enforceable.</p>
