            <p className="text-base text-gray-800">This site was created by a university computer science student to collect information about topics of interest—especially in law and business.</p>
            <p className="text-base text-gray-800">This is not some grand mission or overarching goal; it's simply a library. Like any library, there are good and bad books.</p>
            <p className="text-base text-gray-800">However, the creator feels a strong obligation to maintain factual information—otherwise, this would just be a blog, not a library.</p>
            <p className="text-base text-gray-800">There are interfaces for others to add information, which will be reviewed by the creator (and maybe others in the future). So, it's not just information I collect, but anyone else as well. A true library!</p>
            <p className="text-base text-gray-800 italic">There will be many updates, improvements, and more than likely mistakes, but the goal is open, unfettered, and objective factual access to information—like many others want.</p>
