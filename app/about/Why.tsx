            <h2>However, It is of a great obligation for the creator of the website to maintain factual information as otherwise this would basically be a blog not a library</h2>
            <h2>In doing so their are interfaces in which other people can add their information which will go under review by the creator and maybe others not quite sure how that will work yet so it is not only information I collect but anyone else as well. A true library!</h2>
            <h3>Their will be many updates and improvements and more than likely mistakes but the goal is open, unfettered, and objective factual access to information like many others want.</h3>
